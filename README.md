# 30-days-of-Machine-Learning
Building 30 projects of Machine Learning for sharpening of my skills

Below is the list of problems I aim to solve in the upcoming 30 days—a blend of data, ethics, noise, and insight.

| Day | Problem Name | Category | Description |
| --- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | The XOR Problem (Extended) | Logic / Classification | Go beyond 2D, explore higher-dimensional XOR using shallow nets and feature engineering. |
| 2 | Zoo Dataset (but make it multilingual) | Classification | Can you classify animals with noisy, translated attributes? |
| 3 | Congressional Voting Records (1984) | Binary Classification | Can your model predict ideology from historical votes? |
| 4 | Predicting Chess Outcomes | Regression | Using FIDE ratings, tournament data – predict who wins. |
| 5 | Anderson's Iris, but with real-world noise | Classification | Introduce real-world fuzz into the cleanest dataset ever. |
| 6 | MNIST—But Tiny | Dimensionality Reduction | Reduce it to 2-3 pixels and still try to classify. |
| 7 | Predicting UNIX Commands | Sequence Modeling | Given a session, predict next likely commands. |
| 8 | Wine Quality (Bias-Aware) | Regression | Can you model human bias in wine ratings? |
| 9 | Signal Processing: ECG Classification | Time Series | Detect arrhythmias from raw ECG. |
| 10 | Detecting Fake Science Papers | NLP | Use metadata + abstract to detect gibberish auto-generated research. |
| 11 | Music Genre Classification from Lyrics | NLP + Classification | No audio—just lyrics. Multilingual bonus. |
| 12 | Forest Cover Type Prediction | Multi-Class | A massive but oddly elegant problem. |
| 13 | Predicting Divorce from Questionnaire | Binary Classification | Can ML predict unhappy endings? |
| 14 | The Prison Recidivism Problem | Ethics + ML | Predict repeat offenses. But measure bias and fairness. |
| 15 | EEG Eye State | Time Series | Predict if eyes are open/closed from EEG readings. |
| 16 | Parkinson's Detection | Binary Classification | Use voice samples to detect Parkinson’s Disease. |
| 17 | Visual Word Recognition | NLP + Vision | Combine OCR and NLP to transcribe old scanned books. |
| 18 | Credit Card Fraud Detection | Anomaly Detection | Imbalanced and tricky. |
| 19 | Seizure Prediction from EEG | Time Series | High-dimensional, temporal, noisy. Delicious. |
| 20 | Urban Sound Classification | Audio Classification | Classify real-world noise. Sirens, drills, etc. |
| 21 | Airline Delay Prediction | Regression | Use real flight data. Handle missingness and patterns. |
| 22 | Student Performance Prediction | Regression | Multi-factor prediction: parents, school, habits. |
| 23 | Predicting Song Popularity (Pre-Spotify Era) | Regression | Can you guess hits from metadata, not streams? |
| 24 | Forest Fire Size Prediction | Regression | Geospatial + weather data. Harder than it looks. |
| 25 | Human Activity Recognition from Smartphones | Classification | Classic but still tricky. |
| 26 | Bike Sharing Demand Forecast | Time Series | Forecasting on seasonal + weather + social signals. |
| 27 | Personality Prediction from Essays | NLP | Text-based psychological modeling. |
| 28 | Wikipedia Vandalism Detection | Classification | A hidden gem problem from the early 2010s. |
| 29 | NLP on Legal Contracts | Named Entity / Doc Classification | Annotate and predict clauses, risks. |
| 30 | Build a ML Journal Recommender | Recommender System | Use scraped metadata and abstracts to recommend journals. |
